TODO:
 - diagnose what is the problem with trying to start with the big-switch.rb command.  Currently start with 'ruby genesis.rb'
 - factor out the last config options from the Sender setup (should read from YAML file)
 - make the BotSender subclasses register automatically by discovery.
 - add more BotSender targets
